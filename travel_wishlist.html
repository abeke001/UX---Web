            <h1>My Dream Travel Destinations</h1>
            <ol>My favourite Countries are:
                <li>Saudi Arabia</li>
                <li>Qatar</li>
                <li>Somalia</li>
                <li>Italy</li>
                <li>Kuwait</li>
            </ol>
            <a>I’m really excited about the idea of visiting Somalia, my homeland, where I can connect with the rich culture and beautiful coastline that define my identity. Saudi Arabia holds a special place in my heart as a Muslim; the chance to experience the spiritual significance of Mecca and Medina would be incredibly meaningful for me. I’m also drawn to Qatar, with its mix of modernity and tradition, and I’d love to explore the vibrant souks in Doha. Italy captivates me with its art, history, and delicious cuisine, while Kuwait’s modern architecture and cultural heritage pique my curiosity. Each of these places has something unique to offer, and I can’t wait to experience them.</a>
